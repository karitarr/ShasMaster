# Lifehacking Scripts to make for glorious happy

### ShasMaster

Shasm (Sunday Horror AdventuretimeS Movie) is a weekly ritual a friend and I have to watch horror movies, since there's all of 4 horror movie fans in the bay area.
The ShasMaster script scrapes the rotten tomatoes website and emails a list of all new horror films with a min rating of 70 
(low bar? maybe but terrible horror films deserve love too)  

####How To Use:
1- Clone the repo 

2- Add your email information to the settings file

3- Create a text file to keep track of the movies the script has seen

4- Add the file path to the settings 

5- Run `ruby shasm.rb` from the command line
