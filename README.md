# Lifehacking Scripts to make for glorious happy bashtimes

### ShasMaster

Shasm (Sunday Horror AdventuretimeS Movie) is a ritual I have with a friend to watch horror movies once a week, since there's all of 14 horror movie fans in the bay area.
The ShasMaster script scrapes rotten tomatoes and emails a list of all new horror films with a min rating of 70 
(low bar? never...)  

####How To Use:
1- Clone the repo 

2- Add your email information to the settings file

3- Create a text file to keep track of the movies the script has seen

4-  Add the file path to the settings 

5- Rename the settings_template file to just 'settings'

6- Run `ruby shasm.rb` from the command line in the directory where you cloned the repo
